              <p>
                This article is currently under construction while my team and I
                gather all the information we have collected and build it into a
                format that’s easy for you to read! We’ll be including the
                results of every pencil for every test over the next few weeks.
                For now, you can watch the video below to see the summary, and
                find all of the tested brands with links to purchase below. If
                youd like to be notified by email when everything is updated,
                you can join my email newsletter, and youll also get a free
                coloring book.

                Ultimate White Pen Shopping Guide (White Pen Series: Part 2)
              </h2>
              <p>
                If you caught Part One of this series, you know that I’ve I
                spent countless hours testing and re-testing as many white pens
                as I can find to bring you the ultimate best white pen. I took
                61 white gel pens, white paint pens and white inks and tested
                them on black paper, over pencils and markers and so much more,
                eliminating a few pens at each round until we reached what I
                believe were the final few, best quality pens. In this blog, I
                have put together the ultimate buying guide to white pens and
                markers so you can decide the best white pen for your art. This
                article is part two in our series on White Pens so be sure to
                check out Part 1 HERE and keep an eye out for part 3!
